# Pro JSF  and HTML 5 Example on IntelliJ Idea

> For everyone who're reading Pro JSF and HMTL 5 book, sometimes we want to create a template project to test the funny we get from the book. 
> Even though we have all code example, but I can't import them to my favorite  IDE and make it work with Tomcat. I create this repo to re-make 
> example projects for each chapter then also do something fun with them. Check each chapter to see.
